## Background Info on the MVC Pattern
The MVC pattern has always been a misunderstood architectural pattern that is implemented in 2 basic approaches. Fundamentally the pattern leverages an interaction pattern as shown in Figure 1. The differences are primarily on how the update to the View is implemented in the 2 approaches and their implied dependencies

In some examples the updates are direct calls to the View operators (Dependency from Model to View) and on other examples the Observer pattern is implemented creating a stronger dependency from the View to the Model. 

### Dependencies in the MVC Pattern
The ideal dependency that one wants to achieve in the MVC pattern is from the View and Controller to the Model. The Controller already has a natural dependency from the Controller to the model as the Controller leverages the operators in the Model to update the state of the Model. 

## The Cash Register Application
Going back to the Cash Register Requirements one can define the following significant components: *CashRegister, Display, Keyboard, TicketPrinter, Scanner,* and *ProductDB.*  The responsibilities and operators for each module are listed below:

## Exercises (For each exercise you should create a separate folder in the GitHub) 
1) In this first exercise implement a Cash Register Application using the above components that processes input from the *Keyboard* and/or *Scanner* (Controllers) and outputs the product information on the *Display* and *TicketPrinter* (Views) by interacting with the *CashRegister* (Model). This design should follow a standard interaction pattern where the Controllers depend on the *CashRegister* operators and the *CashRegister* depends on the View operators.  In this exercise I will be looking that *CashRegister* calls the operators in *Display* and *TicketPrinter*.

2) Create a View interface that the Display and TicketPrinter will inherent from that contains an operator called *displayProduct(Product).* Implement this operator in both *Display* and *TicketPrinter* and modify the *CashRegister* component to leverage this operator. This 2nd implementation uses Interfaces to invert the dependency between the Model and View.

3) Modify the original *CashRegister*, *Display* and *TicketPrinter* components from Exercise 1 so that an *Observer* pattern is used where the *Display* and *TicketPrinter* components are Observers to the *CashRegister* components and are notified when the current scanned productâ€™s name and price have been updated. This 3rd implementation uses a Subject / Observer pattern to invert the dependency between the Model and View.

4) Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the 3 approaches.
